# CS50final

Hi! I'm Meera and this is my final project for CS50 python with javascript. It is a newspaper website where you can upload and read articles. There is also an option to submit messages about the articles.

CS50 Capstone file containsall the root files created by Django when initializing a new project: asgi.py, settings.py, urls.py and wsgi.py. In urls.py, I've included the path for my application
media/photos contains 3 images, beirut.jpg, corona.jpg and liverpool.jpg, which feature in articles
The news files contains the css style sheet under the static subfolder, the templates for all html pages, admin.py apps.py, models.py, tests.py, urls.py and views.py
The templates section has all the HTML code for the templates. Index.html leads to the main page, which states today's date, has links to the news articles and has a contact button. new.html enables you to write, edit and save a new article. Search.html enables you to find articles by searching for words in their title. Category.html contains all the different categories for the news articles.
This project has a Django back-end and a JavaScript front-end

My project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements because it is different to all the previous projects, and it utilises Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Django effectively to produce a mobile-responsive web application
